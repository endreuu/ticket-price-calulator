# ticket-price-calulator
Project created to solve a problem in college that seeks to add ticket prices for a show according to the name and age of the audience.

If the spectator has the same name as the protagonist of the show, the ticket will cost $20, if the spectator is under 18 or over 65, 
they will pay half the price ($25), otherwise, the spectator will pay the entire entrance fee ($50).

The program will receive the protagonist's name and the number of entries. Then it will receive the name of the first spectator, then their age, 
then the second spectator and their age, and so on until reaching the number of spectators.
